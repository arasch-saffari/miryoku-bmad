## Key Findings Summary

**Recommended Approach for miryoku.space:**
- Hybrid curriculum with phase-based progression + adaptive difficulty
- FSRS-based spaced repetition for memory optimization
- Multi-dimensional gamification (optional, not mandatory)
- Local-first architecture with optional cloud sync
- Three-phase implementation: MVP → Enhanced → Expert

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- State: Zustand
- Visualization: Three.js (WebGL) for HRM
- Storage: IndexedDB (primary), optional Supabase (sync)
- PWA: Workbox (offline-first)
