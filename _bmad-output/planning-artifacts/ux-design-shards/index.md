## Key Design Decisions Summary

### Core UX Principles:
1. **Just Start Typing** - Zero onboarding friction
2. **3-Phase Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually
3. **HRM-Aware Visualization** - Predictive state feedback (PRIMARY INNOVATION)
4. **Multi-Modal Experience** - 5 distinct modes (Focus, Engagement, Professional, Wellness, Competitive)
5. **Athletic Training Metaphor** - Progression like sports coaching

### Technical Stack:
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Next.js 15
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Components:** shadcn/ui + Magic UI
- **Visualization:** Three.js (WebGL)
- **State:** Zustand
- **Storage:** IndexedDB (local-first)

### Design System:
- **Themeable:** 5 Mode-specific themes
- **Accessible:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- **Responsive:** Desktop-first with mobile optimization
- **Performance:** <100ms load, <16ms frame time

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Predictive Visualization** must be PERFECT (unique value prop)
2. **Onboarding** <5 minutes to first success
3. **Home Row Mods** HRM predictive viz is KEY
4. **Multi-Modal Design** - No one-size-fits-all
5. **Accessibility** - Complete inclusive design
6. **Athletic Metaphor** - Training, not gaming
